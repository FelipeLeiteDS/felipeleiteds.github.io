Hi there,
Having recently completed a Masterâ€™s in Business Administration with a focus on Data Science from the University Canada West, I am eager to explore the next phase of my professional journey with a fresh perspective and a refined skill set.
 

Now, as I continue to evolve in the flourishing data analysis industry, I am looking forward to integrate this cutting-edge expertise with my background in finance and operations. The potential to derive strategic insights from data excites me, and I cannot wait to leveraging this blend of skills to deliver value through data-based decision-making and innovative solutions.
 

My entrepreneurial journey began at the age of 21 when I founded Nex Transport Solutions, an experience that sharpened my leadership abilities and deepened my expertise in financial management, marketing strategy, and operational efficiency. This endeavor was not only a business venture but a vital learning experience that continues to shape my approach to challenges.
 

A passion for research and education has always driven me. For over two years, I served as a post-secondary business instructor in Brazil, where I mentored aspiring professionals and shared real-world insights. This experience underscored the impact that scientific method and knowledge-sharing can have in shaping future leaders and reinforced my belief in the power of education as a transformative tool.
